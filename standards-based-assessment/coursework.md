title: Coursework Assessment
---

There are three types of regular coursework in Math 2500:

  - Daily Homework
  - Class Presentations
  - Weekly Homework

I have decided on a scheme for marking these which feels a little complicated,
but should reward someone who basically keeps up with class work on a regular
basis.  

### Daily Homework

For each class meeting you will complete a short set of tasks. These are to be
written up carefully and brought with you. During class, you may mark up your
paper as much as you wish to correct errors, incomplete understanding, or for
any other reason. **All of these annotations will be made with a felt-tip pen.**
At the end of class, I will collect these papers to look them over. Each
daily assignment will be marked with either a 1 or a 0. I will assign a 1 if I
believe you made a good faith effort to attempt each problem and wrote up your
progress in a reasonable manner. (I don't expect you will always get every task
complete and correct. But I do want you to make a good faith effort to get every
task complete and correct.) There will be about 40 of these assignments.

### Class Presentations

We will spend almost all of our time in class meetings with students presenting
their work on the daily tasks. Each will be graded on a scale of 0-4, with one
mark each for reasonable demonstration of the following standards:

 - correct use of vocabulary
 - mathematically correct work
 - clear oral presentation
 - an extra mark for doing something particularly amazing.

Most good presentations will earn 3 marks.

The class conversation which follows your presentation will provide you with
feedback on the quality of your work.

Our class examinations will naturally divide the semester into three sections.
I will use your top two presentation scores from each section. This means there
are 24 available marks for this work.

### Weekly Homework

Each week I will select two tasks from the daily homework during the previous
week to be written up carefully and professionally. Each of these will be marked
strictly on a 4 point scale for:

  - clarity of written communication
  - correct use of vocabulary
  - clear reasoning from examples to generality
  - correct computational work

So each assignment has a possible 8 marks. Individual problems may be resubmitted
until they earn 3 points. With hard work, it should be that every assignment
earns at least 6 points out of 8.

I anticipate that there will be 14 of these assignments, so a total of 112 marks
is possible.

### Figuring the Grade

I want this grading component to reflect only this: "The student generally kept
up with coursework." So the letter grade will be awarded to students who meet
the following threshold:

  - 125 marks total
  - at least 30 marks on daily homework
  - at least 15 marks on class presentations
  - at least 75 marks on weekly homework
